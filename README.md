Supply chain finance analyzing under customer to manufactory(C2M) model

This project simulated a scheme that contains customer, factory and supplier.
In the scheme, a factory can receive finaceing with customer orders and can
sell financial products to their customer which inply the customer who buy
finacial products may get a little discount in their ordinary goods orders.

How large of the descount should be? The simulation tell us it dependse on
the proportion of period and interest rate of finacial products. On the other
hand, the period and interest rate of finacial products effect the total profit
which also named capital pool. Therefore, it is necessary that a method of
automated control of adjusting the the proportion of period and interest rate
of finacial products in order to make capital pool growing steadily.
